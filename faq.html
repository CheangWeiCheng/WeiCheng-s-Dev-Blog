    <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Can I adjust the vibration on the Duo Wristwatch?<br>
            Currently, the Duo Wristwatch offers a fixed vibration intensity. We designed it with an ideal balance of strength to ensure it's noticeable without being disruptive. If you need to check if the vibration is strong enough, you can easily test it by pressing the doorbell while wearing the watch.
        </li>
        <li>Is the Duo Wristwatch waterproof or water-resistant?<br>
            Yes, the Duo Wristwatch is water-resistant, meaning it can withstand splashes of water or brief exposure to moisture. However, it is not fully waterproof, so we recommend removing the watch before swimming or showering.
        </li>
        <li>Can I use the Duo Wristwatch with other doorbells?<br>
            No, the Duo Wristwatch is designed specifically to work with the Duo Doorbell. The system is tailored to communicate via a unique signal, ensuring that you only receive notifications from your own doorbell.
        </li>
        <li>How do I install the Duo Doorbell?<br>

        </li>
        <li>How far is the range between the Duo Doorbell and Duo Wristwatch?<br>
