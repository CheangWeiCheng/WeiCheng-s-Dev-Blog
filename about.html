        <p>At DUO, we understand the unique challenges faced by the elderly, especially those with hearing impairments. Our mission is simple: to create innovative, practical solutions that enhance the quality of life and foster independence for seniors.</p>
        <p>Our flagship products, the DUO Doorbell and DUO Wristwatch, were designed specifically with hard-of-hearing seniors in mind. After hearing from families and caregivers about the difficulty elderly individuals face when they can’t hear the doorbell, we set out to create a reliable, easy-to-use system that would help seniors stay connected and informed—without the need for loud, disruptive noises.</p>
        <p>The DUO Wristwatch, when paired with the DUO Doorbell, gently vibrates whenever the doorbell rings, and has a button that, when pressed, sends a message to the doorbell. This combination offers a discreet, effective solution to keep seniors informed and independent, whether they’re at home, in the garden, or even in another room.</p>
        <p>We believe that every senior deserves to feel safe, secure, and connected in their own home, regardless of hearing ability. Our products are crafted with care, designed for simplicity, and built to last—because your peace of mind matters to us.</p>
