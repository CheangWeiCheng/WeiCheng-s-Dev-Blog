DUO is a STEAMUnity project that my friends and I have been working on. This website serves as a store where users can purchase the two parts of the DUO product: a wristwatch and a doorbell. The website allows users to add products to their cart and proceed to checkout to purchase the items, with the option to clear the cart upon completion.

The purpose of this website is to provide both information about DUO and a functional shopping system. With its clean and simple design, the website ensures users can easily navigate and access various sections, whether it be information, products, or the cart.
